> In the video, I have demonstrated the output of entering an invalid data type. For instance, when the program was asking for entering a number representing the amount of numbers or letters that the user would like to input. If the type is not correct, the program will stop the user from proceeding until s/he gets that right. 
    > Moreover, if the user chooses to enter a list of numbers but accidentally enters a different type of data, the program will not accept the data until the user enters a correct one.
    
> TestFeature1.java was designed to test feature 1 of the program. In this file, "2", "-10", "100" and "1" were used as a list of integers and were tested. And the output was "-10 1 2 100 ", which matched the expected outcome, indicating that the this list of integers was sorted. Therefore, this test case worked. 

> TestFeature2.java was designed to test feature 2 of the program. In this file, "l", "s", "c", "o" and "d" were used as a list of characters and were tested. And the output was "c d l o s ", which matched the expected outcome, indicating that the this list of characters was sorted. Therefore, this test case worked.
